                <h2><span>I'm a design-obsessed<br/>technocrat in training.</span></h2>

                <p>My passion lies at the nexus of technology and design, user experience (UX).</p>

                <p>Nothing is quite as satisfying than a passerby encountering my work and not having to ask a lot of questions. If they can use it and just *get it*, I've done my job well.</p>

                <p>Thus far in my career, I've worn many hats: front-end developer, designer and brand marketer to name a few. It all boils down to a strong sense of creativity and intrinsic drive to flesh out the "what could be". I don't accept mediocrity, don't slack off and don't hold back when it's time to speak up.
